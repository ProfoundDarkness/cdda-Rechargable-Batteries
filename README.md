# Rechargable Batteries
Basically just adds the rechargable flag to small and medium storage batteries.  Works well with 'Bright Lights' mod.  In fact it's strongly recommended to use 'Bright Lights' but is not mandantory.

Considered adding the flag to 'storage battery' item but there is a quick and easy way to recharge those already in CDDA, 'swappable storage battery case' and that doesn't impose the energy inefficiency of using the 'battery charger' (Bright Lights) or the CDDA UPS charger.

Basically every charge of energy imparted by the recharge mechanism costs you 10 units of energy from the vehicle.
